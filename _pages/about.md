I recently graduated from Harvard where I studied Computer Science and Statistics. My <a href="/publications/"> senior thesis </a> research was advised by the wonderful <a href = "https://procaccia.info/">Professor Ariel Procaccia</a>. I am passionate about research at the interface of economics and computer science.

At Harvard, I co-founded <a href="https://gushclub.org/"> GUSH</a>, an statistics student organization at Harvard that hosts speaker panels, mentorship programs, educational workshops and fun socials. Since my sophomore fall of college, I have taught on <a href = "https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/joseph-k-blitzstein"> Professor Joe Blitzstein</a>'s superstar teaching team for Stat 110 (Intro to Probability) and Stat 111 (Intro to Statistical Inference). You can find my teaching notes <a href="/teaching/"> here</a>.

I am currently working as a Fundamental Analyst at Citadel Securities, where I get to research interesting market situations and observe game theory play out in real-world financial settings. In my free time, I enjoy running, reading, and writing short stories.
